.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. 
It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides 
language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment, known as Common Language Runtime (CLR). 
FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework.
On the other hand C# is just one of the programming languages, supported by the .NET framework. 
It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and is one of the programming languages, designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
